		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Couscous is a staple food traditionally found in North African cuisine, particularly in countries like Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia. It is made from semolina wheat, which is moistened and rolled into tiny granules, then steamed to create a light, fluffy texture. Couscous is incredibly versatile, often used as a base for a variety of dishes, including stews, meats, and vegetables. It has a slightly nutty flavor and a delicate texture that absorbs the flavors of accompanying ingredients, making it a popular choice in many savory recipes.</p>
		<p>Couscous can be prepared in different ways, depending on the region and the specific dish. It is commonly served with a rich and flavorful stew, where vegetables, meats like lamb or chicken, and a blend of spices such as cumin, cinnamon, and saffron are used. The dish is often garnished with dried fruits, nuts, or fresh herbs, adding layers of taste and texture. While traditionally steamed, instant couscous, which cooks quickly by simply adding boiling water, has become widely available, making it a convenient option for modern kitchens. Whether enjoyed as a main dish, side, or even in salads, couscous remains a beloved and enduring element of North African culinary traditions.</p>
