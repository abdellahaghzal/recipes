		<h2>Description</h2>
		<p>Moroccan tajine is a traditional North African dish, named after the earthenware pot in which it is cooked. The tajine pot has a unique conical lid that traps steam during cooking, allowing the food to simmer slowly and develop deep, rich flavors. Tajine dishes typically consist of meat, such as lamb, chicken, or beef, that is braised with a combination of vegetables, fruits like apricots or dates, and a blend of aromatic spices such as cumin, coriander, cinnamon, ginger, and saffron. The slow-cooking process in the tajine pot allows the ingredients to meld together, creating a tender, flavorful stew with a thick, luscious sauce.</p>
		<p>Tajine is a staple of Moroccan cuisine and is often served with couscous or bread to soak up the flavorful sauce. The dish is not only a culinary delight but also a social one, as it is traditionally shared among family and friends from the communal tajine pot. Each region of Morocco has its own variations of tajine, with some versions incorporating olives, preserved lemons, or nuts to enhance the taste. Whether enjoyed at home or in a Moroccan restaurant, tajine offers a warm, comforting meal that showcases the rich culinary heritage of the region.</p>

		<h2>Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li><strong>Prepare the tajine pot:</strong> If using a clay tajine, soak the base and lid in water for about an hour before cooking, especially if it's the first time using it. This helps prevent cracking.</li>
			<li><strong>Heat the olive oil:</strong> Place the tajine pot over low heat and add 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil. Allow it to warm up slowly.</li>
			<li><strong>Sauté the onions and garlic:</strong> Add the chopped onions and minced garlic to the tajine. Sauté them gently until they are soft and translucent.</li>
			<li><strong>Brown the meat:</strong> Add the meat pieces to the tajine, searing them on all sides until they are lightly browned.</li>
			<li><strong>Add the spices:</strong> Sprinkle the ground cumin, coriander, ginger, cinnamon, turmeric, and saffron (if using) over the meat. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Stir to coat the meat evenly with the spices.</li>
			<li><strong>Layer the vegetables:</strong> Arrange the vegetables, such as carrots, potatoes, zucchini, tomatoes, and bell peppers, over the meat. You can create a pyramid shape, with the harder vegetables at the bottom and softer ones on top.</li>
			<li><strong>Add dried fruits and preserved lemons (optional):</strong> Tuck in the dried apricots, prunes, and quartered preserved lemons among the vegetables. Add olives if using.</li>
			<li><strong>Pour in the liquid:</strong> Add 1-2 cups of broth or water, enough to create steam but not to fully submerge the ingredients. The liquid should reach about halfway up the ingredients.</li>
			<li><strong>Cover and cook slowly:</strong> Place the conical lid on the tajine and cook over low heat for 2-3 hours. Resist the urge to lift the lid often, as this will release steam. Check occasionally to ensure there is enough liquid, adding more water or broth if needed.</li>
			<li><strong>Check for doneness:</strong> After 2-3 hours, the meat should be tender, and the vegetables soft. The sauce should be thick and flavorful.</li>
			<li><strong>Garnish with fresh herbs:</strong> Before serving, sprinkle chopped cilantro or parsley over the tajine for added freshness.</li>
			<li><strong>Serve:</strong> Serve the tajine directly from the pot, accompanied by couscous or crusty bread to soak up the sauce. Enjoy!</li>
